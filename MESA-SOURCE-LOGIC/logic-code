Glucose Drift Investigation

The MESA computed diabetes variable (dm031c) was recalculated based upon the newly calibrated glucose values.  A revised dataset was released in November 2007, utilizing the recalibrated fasting glucose values and diabetes variables.  In April 2007, it was discovered that this dataset used erroneous cutoff points for the diabetes variable dm031c, with values of 100 included as normal as opposed to impaired fasting glucose.  This resulted in the misclassification of ~95 individuals as normal instead of IFG.  New datasets for all 4 Exams were released 4/21/08 with the correct values.

Following are tables and figures showing the breakdown of the original diabetes variable prior to calibration, with the erroneous calibration results, and the corrected version  of the data.  Investigators who downloaded datasets for use between November 2007 and April 2008 and used the diabetes variables should acquire these revised datasets.

The 2003 ADA guidelines for Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) levels are as follows:
FPG <100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) = normal fasting glucose; 
FPG 100–125 mg/dl (5.6–6.9 mmol/l) = IFG (impaired fasting glucose); 
FPG 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) = provisional diagnosis of diabetes (the diagnosis must be confirmed, as described below).

Framingham risk, NCEP version
fr_totc	As of 17 August 2006, this variable is not included in the Exam 1 main dataset.  This variable measures the points for calculating 10-year risk of developing hard CHD (MI and CHD death).  This measure relies upon age [age1c], total cholesterol [chol1], current smoking status [cig1c], hdl [hdl1], systolic blood pressure [sbp1c] and presence of hypertension medication [htnmed1c] for its calculations.  Men and women [gender1] are scored separately.  No adjustment has been made for participant use of lipid lowering medications at the time of blood draw.  This measure should not be used in analysis; use the Framingham 10-year risk of CHD instead.  To find the Framingham risk point score, sum the points from the tables below.  For example, a male, age 66, cholesterol 232, HDL 54, smoker, and systolic blood pressure of 132 without hypertension treatments will have a point score of 11+1+0+1+1=14.  

A missing value sets this entire variable to be missing, unless the missing value would have no effect on the total points.  (missing htnmed1c when sbp1c is less than 120, for example)  This scoring algorithm is oriented towards cholesterol treatment decisions.  Since diabetes is considered a CHD risk-equivalent, diabetics are automatically recommended for treatment, and the risk scoring does not include diabetes as a factor. For this reason, the 10 year risk estimates do not apply to diabetics, and this variable is set to missing for anyone with glucose1 >=126 mg/dl or on diabetes treatment.  [dm031c=2 or 3]  The algorithm is also only applicable for ages<80, however, for ages 80-85 we assigned them a risk as though they were age 79.   
NOTE: Tables and methods taken directly from NCEP summary, reference #4.

Framingham Point Scores for Men










Framingham Point Scores for Women










Framingham 10-year risk of CHD, NCEP version
frncep1c	Risk of developing hard CHD within 10 years, calculated from the NCEP Framingham risk point scores.  Men and women use different tables to find their values:


From the previous example, the man with a point score of 14 has an estimated probability of 16% with regards to experiencing a CHD in 10 years.  The actual value of FrNCEP1c would be 0.16

NOTE: Tables and methods taken directly from NCEP summary, reference #4.

Framingham risk, JAMA version 
frjama1c	Risk of developing hard CHD within 10 years, calculated from the JAMA Framingham risk survival model.  These scores were developed using Cox proportional hazards models, using a separate model for each gender.  The models are not recalibrated to the MESA data; the average values of the Framingham covariates are used and the published Framingham average incidence rates are used.  The variables used in calculating FR_JAMA1c are age1c, htnstg1c, chol1, hdl1, dm031c, glucose1, cig1c and gender1.  The algorithm is only applicable for ages<75, however, however for older participants we assigned them a risk as though they were age 74.  The survival model’s means and coefficients are provided from the JAMA Framingham Cox regression.  For the precise method used to calculate this variable, consult the Created Variables Code Repository.

Framingham risk, Circulation version 
frcirc1c	Estimated 10 year risk of all CHD events by Framingham equation published in Circulation in 1998 [7].  This algorithm is very similar to that used in FR_JAMA1c above, only predicting all CHD (MI, CHD death, angina) instead of hard CHD.   The same risk factors and modeling strategy are used for both.  The algorithm is only applicable for ages<75, however, however for older participants we assigned them a risk as though they were age 74.  For the precise method used to calculate this variable, consult the Created Variables Code Repository.

MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

OVERALL CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH SCORE
How it was coded:
Using the seven components listed in Table 1, we summed the values assigned to each component. Scores ranged from 0-14. Participants who scored between 0-7 were considered to have poor cardiovascular health; scores between 8 and 11 were considered to be intermediate cardiovascular health; scores of 12 or greater was considered to be ideal cardiovascular health. The score was assigned to participants who had complete data on all seven components. 

Components to in calculating the score:
Smoking, BMI, Physical activity, Diet, Total Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, Fasting plasma glucose. The methods for calculating and coding each component is listed below. 


Smoking
MESA variables used: 
cig1c, Cigarette smoking status
agequit1, Cigarettes: Age quit smoking
age1c, Age at Exam 1

How it was coded: The variable “cig1c” contains cigarette smoking status, measured as, never, former, current. Current smokers were coded as poor for the CVH metric while never smokers were coded as ideal. Former smokers who quit smoking more than a year ago (calculated by subtracting agequit1 from age1c), were coded as ideal for the CVH metric, while former smoker who quit less than one year ago were coded intermediate. 

BMI
MESA variable used: 
bmi1c, Body mass index [kg/m2]

How it was coded: Participants with BMI  ≥ 30 kg/m2 was coded as poor for the CVH metric, BMI  ≥ 25 and < 30 kg/m2 was coded as intermediate, and BMI  < 25 kg/m2 was coded as ideal.

Cholesterol
MESA variables used: 
chol1, Total cholesterol (mg/dL)
lipid1c, Any lipid-lowering medication (medication inventory)

How it was coded: 
The variable “chol1” contained a measure of total cholesterol. Participants with cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dL were coded as poor for the CVH metric; cholesterol ≤200 or >240 mg/dL was coded as intermediate. Participants whose cholesterol was < 200 mg/dL were coded as ideal, unless the participant was also taking lipid lowering medication, in which case they were coded as intermediate. 

MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

Blood Pressure
MESA variables used: 
sbp1c, Seated systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
dbp1c, Seated diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) 
htnmed1c, Hypertension medication (medication inventory)

How it was coded: 
Participants with SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 were coded as poor for the CVH metric. SBP between < 140 and ≥ 120 or DBP between < 90 and  ≥ 80 were coded as intermediate. SBP < 120 and DBP < 80 was coded as ideal. If SBP < 120 and DBP < 80, and the participant was taking antihypertension medication, they were coded as intermediate. 

Fasting Plasma Glucose
MESA variables used: 
glucos1c, Fasting glucose (mg/dL) calibrated
dm031c, Exam 1 Diabetes Mellitus by 2003 ADA fasting criteria algorithm 

How it was coded: 
Participants with glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL were coded as poor for the CVH metric; glucose ≥ 100 and  < 236 mg/dL, was coded as intermediate. Glucose < 100 was coded as ideal, except for participants who were taking diabetes medication (dm031= 3, treated diabetes), who were coded as intermediate.

Dietary Recommendations

At the baseline examination, MESA participants filled out a modified-Block 120-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that asked about average consumption of specific food items over the previous year. 

How it was coded: 
The diet metric is composed of five dietary factors: intake of fruits and vegetables, fish, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, and fiber-rich whole grains. Each dietary factor has a recommended intake (e.g., ≥ 4.5 cups of fruits and vegetables per day). Participants who met 0-1 of the criteria were coded as poor. Participants who met 2-3 of the criteria were coded as intermediate. Participants who met 4-5 of the criteria were coded as ideal. 
MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

Individual Components

Component 1: Fruits and Vegetables >= 4.5 cups per day

MESA variables used:
fgfruit1c, Food group: Fruit
fgfruitjuice1c, Food group: Fruit Juice
fglegumes1c, Food group: Legumes
fgvgreenleafy1c, Food group: Green Leafy Vegetables
fgvcrucifer1c, Food group: Cruciferous Vegetables
fgvdyellow1c, Food group: Dark Yellow Vegetables
fgvpotato1c, Food group: Potato (Vegetables)
fgvother1c, Food group: Other Vegetables 
fgavocado1c, Food group: Avocado
fgtomato1c, Food group: Tomato
fgfriedpotato1c Food group: Fried Potato

How it was coded: 
The fruit and vegetable food groups listed in the variables above are “calculated variables” in MESA that combined individual food items on the MESA FFQ. For example, the variable “fgfruit1c” was the sum of servings per day of fruits that were asked about separately (apples, bananas, oranges, dried fruits, and so forth). To convert servings per day into cups per day, the variables were divided by two (1 serving = ½ cup).If the total fruit/vegetable cups per day were ≥ 4.5, participants were coded as a Yes/Criteria met. If the total fruit/vegetable cups per day were < 4.5, participants were coded as No/Criteria not met. 

Assumptions Made:
The MESA FFQ did not allow us to calculate servings in exact cups per day for individual food items.  The American Heart Association classifies one serving of fruits/vegetables as 1 cup of raw leafy vegetables (about the size of a small fist), 1/2 cup of other vegetables or 1/2 cup of vegetable juice, 1 medium fruit (medium is defined as the size of a baseball), or 1/2 cup chopped, cooked or canned fruit; or 1/2 cup juice. Therefore, we decided to consider one serving of fruit/vegetables as ½ cup, which covers the majority of the food items and is consistent with how other studies coded their cups of fruit and vegetables per day for the CVH score. 


Component 2: Fish (preferably oily fish) ≥ two 3.5-oz servings per week 

MESA variables used:
fgfish1c, Food group: Fish

How it was coded:
Fish consumption per week was calculated by multiplying the food group servings per day by 7. If participants consumed ≥ 2 servings per week, they were coded as a Yes/Criteria met; < 2 servings was coded as No/Criteria not met.
MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

Assumptions Made:
We assumed that one serving of fish was equivalent to at least a 3.5 ounce serving of fish. The average fast food fish sandwich is 4-5 ounces; 1 piece of sushi is about one ounce. We assumed that most servings of fish were above the 3.5 ounce threshold. 


Component 3: Sodium 

MESA variables used:
nan1c, Nutrients: Sodium (mg)

How it was coded:
Dietary sodium was estimated by multiplying the frequency and serving size for each food item from the FFQ by the nutrient content of that food sodium intake (Nutrition Data Systems for Research; University of Minnesota). Where sodium was estimated to be less than 1500 mg per day, participants were coded as Yes/Criteria met; sodium > 1500 mg per day was coded as No/Criteria not met.  

Component 4: Sugar Sweetened Beverages <= 450 kcals (36 oz) per week

MESA variables used:
frqorangejuice1, Frequency of Orange juice
srvorangejuice1,  Serving size of Orange juice
frqotherjuice1, Frequency of  Other juice
srvotherjuice1,  Serving size of Other juice
frqsoda1,  Frequency of Soda
srvsoda1,  Serving size of Soda
frqsugarcoffeetea1,  Frequency of  Sugar in Coffee/Tea
srvsugarcoffeetea1,  Serving size of Sugar in Coffee/Tea
frqsweetmilk1, Frequency of Sweet milk
srvsweetmilk1, Serving size of Sweet milk
frqinstant1,  Frequency of Instant breakfast
srvinstant1,  Serving size of Instant breakfast
frqcocoa1,  Frequency of  Hot cocoa
srvcocoa1,  Serving size of Hot cocoa
addqcalciumfort1, Added: Calcium-fortified juice
addqvitcfort1, Added: Vitamin C-fortified juice
gender1, Gender
age1c, Age at Exam 1

MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

How it was coded:
In order to determine whether participants were above or below the threshold for sugar sweetened beverages, we needed to convert the FFQ food items into some measure of weight. The Data System for Research (NDSR) from the University of Minnesota was used to calculate the weights of food in grams. We then converted the gram weights to monthly ounces and summed all of the sugar sweetened beverages. Items included orange juice, other juice, soda, coffee or tea with sugar, sweet milk, instant breakfast, and hot cocoa. We divided the sum of the items by four to get the weekly intake. If weekly intake of sugar sweetened beverages was less than or equal to 36 ounces, participants were coded as Yes/Criteria met. If weekly intake was greater than 36 ounces, participants were coded as No/Criteria not met. 

Assumptions made:
MESA FFQ did not give a standard measurement to any particular serving size. The gram weights are assigned based on specific sex and age categories.  It assumes that portion size differs among men and women, across age groups, and across different food items. 

Component 5: Fiber rich whole grains (>1.1 g of fiber per 10 g of carbs): >= 3 1 oz equivalent servings per day

MESA variables used: 
fgwholegrain1c, Food Group: Whole Grain

How it was coded:
If servings of whole grains was greater than or equal to 3 per day, participants were coded as Yes/Criteria met. If servings of whole grains was less than 3, participants were coded as No/Criteria not met. 

Assumptions made:
We assumed that 1 serving of whole grains was approximately a 1 ounce serving. 

Physical Activity

MESA variables used:
q09wmcn1,  Moderate walking exercise (min/wk)
q10smcn1,  Moderate dance (min/wk)
q13smcn1,  Moderate individual activities (min/wk)
q14cmcn1,  Moderate conditioning (min/wk)
q11svcn1,  Vigorous team sports (min/wk)
q12svcn1,  Vigorous dual sports (min/wk)
q15cvcn1,  Vigorous conditioning (min/wk)

MESA Life’s Simple Seven / Cardiovascular Health Score (continued)

How it was coded:
Moderate activities and vigorous activities were summed separately. Participants were classified as poor for the CVH metric if their moderate and vigorous physical activity minutes per week totaled zero. Participants were classified as intermediate if their moderate physical activity was between 0 and 150 min/wk, if their vigorous activity was between 0 and 75 min/week, or if their combined moderate and vigorous activity combined was between 0 and 150 min/wk. Participants were classified as ideal if their moderate physical activity was 150 min/wk or greater, if their vigorous activity was 75 min/wk or greater, or their combined moderate and vigorous activity was 150 min/wk or greater.

Assumptions made:
MESA collected information on a longer list of moderate and vigorous activities. The guidelines mention only intentional physical activity. When we originally used the MESA variables total moderate and total vigorous activity, we had a significantly more active population than the sample used from NHANES and the replicated results from ARIC. We then switched to reflect intentional physical activity only, resulting in similar numbers to the other two samples.

MESA has calibrated all serum insulin assay results (from Exam 1 [Beckman Access], MESA Family [Mercodia], and Exam 5 [Elecsys]) on the same scale (Elecsys assay used at Exam 5).

* Calibrate insulin from Beckman to Elecsys standard using Craig's slope/intercept algorithm.

Compute inslnr1t = (0.208 * (Insulin1 * 6.0)) + 1.656.
Execute.

* Use Family-cohort recoded Insulin for Family cohort, which uses a Mercodia-Elecsys calibration.

if (family=1) inslnr1t=inslnr1c_fam.
Execute.

Variable [inslnr1c_fam] was computed for the family cohort according to the following calibration equation:
(x=Mercodia, y=Elecsys):
<= 30 mU/L (y = 0.9004x - 0.0594) and 
>  30 mU/L (y = 1.0602x - 5.3762)

* Recode 114 cases that were re-assayed using Elecysys standard; no need for further calibration.

if (InsulinRA>0) inslnr1t=InsulinRA.
Execute.



Calibration Background:
We would like to compare the new Serum Insulin assay at Exam 5 with serum insulin values obtained from an old assay performed at Exam 1.
115 randomly selected specimens within Exam 1 insulin value decile strata were selected for reassay with the Exam 5 methods.
mIU/L to pmol/L unit conversion factor is 6.0

Z-Score Maximum IMT

ZMXIMT1C = A composite Z score for overall maximal IMT by summing the two carotid IMT sites (maxcom1c and maxint1c) after standardization (subtraction of the mean and division by the standard deviation of each measure), then dividing by the standard deviation of the sum. If only one of the two measures was available, it was used.

Factor VIII

f81c = 7.123025 + ( 0.5611548 * f81 )

Factor VIIIc levels were determined by measuring the clot time of a sample in factor VIIIc deficient plasma in the presence of activators utilizing the Sta-R analyzer (STA-Deficient VIII; Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). The results are given as percent factor VIII, with reported normal plasma range of factor VIII in the adult population between 60 and 150%. 

The analytical CV was __%. The FVIIIc standard curve is linear in a limited range, so samples were diluted more than usual (1/40) to allow more of them to be analyzed without further redilution. However, this resulted in overall higher FVIIIc values than is seen with the original 1/10 dilution. To correct for this, we analyzed 98 samples using both dilutions and analyzed the data by regression: 

Corrected Value = 0.56 Measured Value + 7.1; R = 0.78, a value consistent with the repeatability of a clot-based factor assay. Based on this analysis, the MESA sample data were corrected using this relationship.

EXECUTE.
WHERE:
Variable [prvdna1] = Exam 1 Consent for Genetics Testing: Allow private company access to DNA
[prvdna1] value of  0 = No
[prvdna1] value of  1 = Yes

RECODE cucmcn1c (999=0).
EXECUTE.
* Comment: If the previous conditions are not met, compute [cucmcn1c] recode 999 to 0 (No), since no Commercial Use consent information.

To ensure its accuracy, this new Commercial Use Consent variable [cucmcn1c] has been validated against other iterations of the Commercial Consent Use variable, such as:
[ComUs12c]  Permission to use DNA, samples, data for commercial purposes
[consent] SHARE Commercial Consent
[commuse] Apolipoprotein A ancillary study selection
New variable [cucmcn1c] has been deemed valid and will be added to MESA Exam datasets. The previous Commercial Use Consent variable [ComUs12c] will be dropped from MESA Exam datasets.
